**Today's Progress**: Created #100DaysOfCode Challenge in my Data Scientists party on Habitica. Logged into Kaggle.com and HackerRank.com to get an overview of the lessons and competitions. Also browsed FreeCodeCamp.com/map

**Thoughts:** Kaggle seems the most specialized for data science, but I still need to learn more R Programming before I'm ready for Kaggle. I think I will use my library book, R in 24 Hours, and my Coursera lessons as my curriculum.






### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
